JavaScript function calls exercise for #onemoreround

## Goal

Practice writing functions in JavaScript by writing them so the function calls in the exercise files work.

## How to

Init the repository after cloning
`npm install`

Look for comments in the code, make a file, write a function, import it.
You don't need to change `app.js` ;)
